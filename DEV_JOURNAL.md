## CRM and Sales Pipeline Module

### Task Summary
Implemented the core `Lead` and `Quote` models along with their respective migrations, enums (`LeadStatus`, `QuoteStatus`), and policies to ensure multi-tenant data isolation. Also introduced a domain action for quote creation.

### Design Patterns
**Domain Actions for Quote Creation (`CreateQuoteAction`):**
We utilize a dedicated Action class (`app/Actions/Quotes/CreateQuoteAction.php`) for generating quotes instead of placing this logic in controllers or models. This approach:
1. **Encapsulates Business Logic**: Generating a quote involves specific rules (calculating validity dates, generating unique quote numbers). Keeping this in an Action ensures the logic is reusable across different entry points (e.g., API, Livewire components, Artisan commands).
2. **Improves Testability**: The action can be unit-tested in isolation without mocking HTTP requests or complex controller dependencies.
3. **Adheres to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Models remain thin (handling only data structure and relationships), and controllers remain focused on request/response flow.

**Lead Magnet Flow Integration:**
The system is designed so that when a potential client interacts with a "Lead Magnet" (e.g., requesting a free website audit), a new `Lead` record is created with a status of `new` (or `audited`). 
- The `audit_report_url` column in the `leads` table stores the link to the automatically generated report.
- Once the lead is engaged, the `CreateQuoteAction` can be triggered to transition the flow from Lead to an active Sales Pipeline (Quote), linking the two records via the `lead_id` foreign key.

### Presentation Tip
"By encapsulating the quote generation process within a dedicated Domain Action, we decouple complex business rules from our controllers, ensuring high reusability and maintainability as our sales pipeline logic evolves."
